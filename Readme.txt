Classifying cat-dog images:
1.Downloaded the kaggle dataset of cat and dog images.
2.Made the dataset in the form of 2 folders,1 containing dog images and the other cat so that 
  flow_from_directory can be used.
3.Made the convolutional neural network of 4  layers.
4.Compiled the model.
5.Did data augmentation using keras Image data generator to increase efficiency.
6.Trained the model and did the normalisation.(10 epochs of 25 batch size)
7.Saved the model.
8.Used the saved model to predict the output of individual images.
